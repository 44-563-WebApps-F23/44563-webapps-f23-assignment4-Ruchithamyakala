        <h5>Dr.Stockmann:</h5> <p>I have done my duty.</p> <br>
        
        <h5>Morten Kiil:</h5> <p>What was that you said about the tanneries at Molledal?</p> <br>
        
        <h5>Dr. Stockmann:</h5> <p>You heard well enough. I said they were the source of all the filth.</p> <br>
        
        <h5>Morten Kiil:</h5> <p>My tannery too?</p> <br>
        
        <h5>Dr. Stockmann:</h5> <p>Unfortunately your tannery is by far the worst.</p> <br>
        
        <h5>Morten Kiil:</h5> <p>Are you going to put that in the papers?</p> <br>
        
        <h5>Dr. Stockmann:</h5> <p>I shall conceal nothing.</p> <br>
                        
        <h5>A Stout Man:</h5><p>[going UP to CAPTAIN HORSTER, Without taking any notice of the ladies]</p>  <p>Well, Captain, so you lend your house to enemies of the people?</p> <br>

        <h5>Horster:</h5> <p>I imagine I can do what I like with my own possessions, Mr.Vik.</p> <br>
        
        <h5>The Stout Man:</h5> <p>You shall hear from me in the morning.</p> <p>[Turns his back on him and moves off.]</p> <br>
                                                   
        <h5>Dr. Stockmann:</h5> <p>My hat and coat, Petra! Captain, have you room on your ship for passengers to the New World?</p> <br>
        
        <h5>Horster:</h5> <p>For you and yours we will make room, Doctor.</p> <br>
        
        <h5>Dr. Stockmann:</h5> <p>[as PETRA helps him into his coat]</p> <p>Good. Come,Katherine! Come, boys!</p> <br>
        
        <h5>Mrs. Stockmann:</h5> <p>[in an undertone]</p> <p>Thomas, dear, let us go out by the back way.</p> <br>
        
        <h5>Dr. Stockmann:</h5> <p>No back ways for me, Katherine, <p>[Raising his voice.]</p>You will hear more of this enemy of the people, before he shakes the dust off his shoes upon you! I am not so forgiving as a certain Person; I do
            not say: "I forgive you, for ye know not what ye do."</p> <br>
