    <h6>An Enemy of the People by Henrik Ibsen</h6>

   Horster: I thought you might all sit here; you can slip out easily from here,if things get too lively.<br>

   Mrs. Stockmann: Do you think there will be a disturbance? <br>

   Horster: One can never tell—with such a crowd. But sit down, and don’t be uneasy.<br>

   Mrs. Stockmann: (sitting down) It was extremely kind of you to offer my husband the room.<br>

   Horster: Well, if nobody else would— <br>

   Petra: (who has sat down beside her mother) And it was a plucky thing to do,Captain Horster. <br>

   Horster: Oh, it is not such a great matter as all that.<br>
    
   (HOVSTAD and ASLAKSEN make their way through the crowd.) <br>

   Aslaksen: (going up to HORSTER) Has the Doctor not come yet? <br>

   Horster: He is waiting in the next room. (Movement in the crowd by the door at the back.) <br>

   Hovstad: Look—here comes the Mayor! <br>

   Billing: Yes, I’m damned if he hasn’t come after all! <br>

(PETER STOCKMANN makes his way gradually through the crowd, bows courteously,
and takes up a position by the wall on the left. Shortly afterwards Dr.
STOCKMANN comes in by the right-hand door. He is dressed in a black
frock-coat, with a white tie. There is a little feeble applause, which is
hushed down. Silence is obtained.) <br>

   Dr. Stockmann: (in an undertone) How do you feel, Katherine? <br>

   Mrs. Stockmann: All right, thank you. (Lowering her voice.) Be sure not to lose your temper, Thomas.
