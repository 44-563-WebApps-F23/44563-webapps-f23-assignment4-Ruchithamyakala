        Dr. Stockmann: I have done my duty. <br><br>

        Morten Kiil: What was that you said about the tanneries at Molledal? <br><br>
        
        Dr. Stockmann: You heard well enough. I said they were the source of all the filth. <br><br>
        
        Morten Kiil: My tannery too? <br><br>
        
        Dr. Stockmann: Unfortunately your tannery is by far the worst. <br><br>
        
        Morten Kiil: Are you going to put that in the papers? <br><br>
        
        Dr. Stockmann: I shall conceal nothing.<br><br>
        
        Morten Kiil: That may cost you dearly, Stockmann. (Goes out.)<br><br>
        
        A Stout Man: (going UP to CAPTAIN HORSTER, Without taking any notice of the ladies) Well, Captain, so you lend your house to enemies of the people?<br><br>
        
        Horster: I imagine I can do what I like with my own possessions, Mr.Vik.<br><br>
        
        The Stout Man: Then you can have no objection to my doing the same with mine.<br><br>
        
        Horster: What do you mean, sir?<br><br>
        
        The Stout Man: You shall hear from me in the morning. (Turns his back on him and moves off.)<br><br>
        
        Petra: Was that not your owner, Captain Horster?<br><br>
        
        Horster: Yes, that was Mr. Vik the shipowner.<br><br>
        
        Billing: Three cheers for the Chairman!<br><br>
        
        The whole crowd: Three cheers for Aslaksen! Hurrah!<br><br>
        
        Dr. Stockmann: My hat and coat, Petra! Captain, have you room on your ship for passengers to the New World?<br><br>
        
        Horster: For you and yours we will make room, Doctor.<br><br>
        
        Dr. Stockmann: (as PETRA helps him into his coat) Good. Come,Katherine! Come, boys!<br><br>
        
        Mrs. Stockmann: (in an undertone) Thomas, dear, let us go out by the back way.<br><br>
        
        Dr. Stockmann: No back ways for me, Katherine, (Raising his voice.) You will hear more of this enemy of the people, before he shakes the dust off his shoes upon you! I am not so forgiving as a certain Person; I do
        not say: "I forgive you, for ye know not what ye do."
